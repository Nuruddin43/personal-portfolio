                <p>Soraya Bahgat spoke to Verified about how it felt to have the virus and remembered her grandmother,
                    who sadly died from COVID-19.
                    In the app, she asks us all to take care of our health and to help stop the spread of COVID-19 to
                    save lives.
                    There is now real hope that vaccines will help end the pandemic. But until it is over, we must stay
                    vigilant and continue to protect our loved ones by wearing masks, physically distancing and washing
                    our hands.</p>
